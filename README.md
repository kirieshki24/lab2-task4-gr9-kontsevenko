## Overview
This project implements a program in C that works with a structure `MARSHRUT1`. The structure stores route information, including:
- Route number
- Start point
- End point
- Route length

The program provides functions to:
- Create a list of up to 10 routes
- Find the shortest route
- Sort routes by length
- Display routes that start or end at a specified point

## Usage
### Compilation and Execution
1. Compile the project using `make`:
   ```sh
   make
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```sh
   ./program
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter and manipulate route data.

### Cleaning Up
To remove compiled files:
```sh
make clean
```

## Building
- The project uses `make` for compilation and dependency management.
- A `Makefile` is provided for automated building.
- GitHub Actions are configured to compile the project on push and pull requests.
